Competitions
============

The Clemson ACM competes in two programming/algorithms competitions each year. We compete in the ACM Southeast Regional in the fall and in the Mercer Programming Contest in the spring.

We have had some success. In 2015, we had a team invited to compete in the North America Invitational Programming Competition. We have taken first place for the last two years at the Mercer Programming Competition. We hope to send many more placing teams in the future.

If you are interested in joining us, you should come to Daniel 413 on Tuesdays from 5:30pm to 7:00pm for our weekly practice.

We also prepare a team hackpack. The hackpack is a programming resource designed to aid with ACM style programming competitions. It has some sample contest problems as well as some code for common algorithms. You can find the current version of hackpack [here][] or the source code on [GitHub][].
