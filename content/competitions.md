Competitions
============

Our competitive programming team competes annually in the [International Collegiate Programming Contest][]. In 2024, we had one of the two Clemson teams advance from the Southeast regional competition to the National competition.

We also prepare a team hackpack. The hackpack is a programming resource designed to aid with ACM style programming competitions. It has some sample contest problems as well as some code for common algorithms. You can find the current version of hackpack [here][] or the source code on [GitHub][].

Interested in competing? Reach out to us at [acm@cs.clemson.edu](mailto:acm@cs.clemson.edu).
