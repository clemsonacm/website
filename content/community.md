Community Events
================

We strive to offer events that build community amongst computer scientists here at Clemson. To this end we host 3 LAN parties and 1 cookie break each semester. For dates for these events, check out our [calendar][].

LAN Parties
-----------

At our LAN parties, we have all sorts of PC games including Team Fortress and Rocket League. In addition to PC games, we also have several versions of Smash Brothers including Melee, Project M, and Smash 4. At our LAN party events, we provide snacks and drinks; but we ask that attendees chip in $5 for pizza.

Cookie Break
------------

For members of Clemson ACM, we offer generally offer 1 cookie break each semester. As expected, we have a selection of cookies and milk. These events are a chance to take a break from compiling, debugging, and studying and play games with other human beings. We often have a small selection of board and card games to accompany our cookies and milk. We also use this event as a chance to send off our programming teams before competitions.
