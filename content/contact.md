Contact Us
==========

We have a [Discord][] server where we announce events, share personal projects, take suggestions for improvement, and just talk.

If you want to get updates from us, email <acm@cs.clemson.edu> and ask to be added to the mailing list. We send out several neat computing emails as events approach so you won't miss a thing.

If you want to get in contact with the officers, email us at <acm@cs.clemson.edu>.
