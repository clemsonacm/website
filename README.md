ACM Website
===========

Right now this is only a mockup and a partial implementation. The idea is a website that looks (and interacts if you have JavaScript!) like an emacs session.

I still haven't picked a colour scheme so right now it uses fairly standard terminal colours.

I'm probably going to look into [Hugo](https://github.com/spf13/hugo) because Go is cool. Otherwise, I'll just put this in a Jekyll workspace I have ready.

Design Goals
------------

- have fully semantic HTML (i.e. no `<div>` soup and be easily human readable in raw HTML)
- look like a potential emacs session
- support emacs ("Escape Meta Alt Control Shift") shortcuts for basic functions (to start with, it will only support changing buffers)
- have a working command line with a joke or two (like http://uni.xkcd.com/)
- easy to navigate (potential pages are easy to find and go to for "point-and-click" users)
- have content be easily readable (so no tiny terminal font like many of us might be accustomed to)
